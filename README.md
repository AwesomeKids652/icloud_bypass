# iCloud Bypass!
A iCloud Bypass app!
## How to use?
if you are on mac, you will need to compile using `gcc bypass.c -o bypass` and run `./bypass` then your done! make sure you connect ur idevice or it will
not work!
ok so... now on linux?
## Linux
simply download the latest release and `./bypassr` and your done! 
it's completely made in C
## Windows
hey hey, its a shell script! not a c program ok. its made in shell i compiled it to C
even if you turn it into a EXE nd run it, it will not work. it will simply fail to bypass, as you need to JB with checkra1n.


## Support
only works on checkra1n and any other JB that has iproxy SSH support.
recommended to use checkra1n

## How it works?
Simply works by clearing the old icloud user cache and deleting setup.app.
and respringing the device, killing backboardd

## MY HOME BUTTON IS BROKEN!
Ahh, `killall backboard` sometimes does that! simply restart.
since the old icloud user data is gone, you will be in home screen, not in setup.app.

## Dosen't Work!
that's your fault dumbo.
our method is completely simple.

## Shell code?
in late 2021.
